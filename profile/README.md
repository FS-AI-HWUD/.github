# Hydrakon: Autonomous Racing by Atlas Racing FS

**Hydrakon** is the full stack autonomous system developed by **Atlas Racing**, The Formula Student team from Heriot Watt University Dubai. 

## Project Overview
Hydrakon is a modular, ROS2 based architecture that enables real-time autonomous driving in both simulations (Carla) and on the physical track (ADS-DV). Our system is designed for the Formula Student AI/Driverless competition and research in autonomous navigration, planning, and control

## Features we're activly working on developing
- **Perception:** Cone detection using camera (depth and mono) only
- **Path Planning:** Adaptive Pure Pursuit with turn classification and dynamic widening
- **Control:** Working on implementing PID and MPC controllers
- **Vehicle Interface:** CAN-based communication for interfacing directly with the ADS-DV

## Hydrakon Versions
- **Hydrakon V1** was developed as part of our participation in the FS UK 2025, Below are the code bases for Hydrakon V1. ***These repositories are not maintained anymore***.
    - [HydrakonV1](https://github.com/FS-AI-HWUD/HydrakonV1) houses the code we used to control the ADS-DV directly
    - [HydrakonSimV1](https://github.com/FS-AI-HWUD/HydrakonSimV1) houses the code we used to build and develop our simulation in Carla

## Previous competition Performance
- At **Formula Student UK 2025**, Hydrakon powered Atlas Racing to:
    - **Real World AI Award Winners**
    - **Babcock Overall Statics Award Winners**
    - **First GCC-based team to claim the stage at Formula Student**
